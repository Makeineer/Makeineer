Hello there,
- I’m Makeineer, a developer on Roblox. As you can see by my profile, I am a ‘Builder’ or CSG Modeler and a Game Designer. Apart from those two, I am also a Graphic Designer and am responsible for implementing and/or modifying some Lua scripts.

- I’ve worked with many teams such as Regional Express (REX) and other individual creators. I originally joined the platform in late 2013 and began developing in 2016. If you’d like to contact me, please use one of the three methods listed below. I often check Discord, however I’m interested in communicating by Email. I’m excited to see what the Roblox multiverse will become in these next years, and I hope you agree.
